No accountability.
No remorse.
No one steps down.

A Dreamliner crashes, the first in the world!!!
Medical students, families, crew, all gone in seconds!
A national tragedy, reduced to a shrug by the Home Minister

And where is the Prime Minister?
No address. No visit. No condolence.
He’s visible only on the campaign trail..
When it's time to seek votes, he’s everywhere.
But when it’s time to lead in crisis, he vanishes.

Is this leadership or cowardice in disguise?

From train infernos and bridge collapses to COVID mismanagement and now a plane crash...
Not one resignation. Not one minister held accountable.
Power stays untouched. Grief, ignored. Lives, reduced to statistics.

This isn’t governance. This is abandonment.

India doesn't just deserve infrastructure and slogans.
India deserves a leader who stands with the people when it hurts the most.

In a stunning development following one of India’s deadliest aviation disasters, a British man has miraculously survived the fiery crash of Air India Flight AI171, which plummeted into a residential area moments after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, on June 12, 2025. Authorities now say additional survivors may be receiving treatment in local hospitals, offering hope amid profound loss.

The London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, carrying 242 passengers and crew—including 169 Indians, 53 Britons, 7 Portuguese, and 1 Canadian—crashed at 1:38 p.m. local time, striking a doctors’ hostel at BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital. The impact killed at least 204 people, including 5 medical students on the ground, and injured nearly 50 others. Thick plumes of black smoke and charred wreckage marked the scene as rescue teams battled flames to search for survivors.

The Survivor: Vishwash Kumar Ramesh
Identified as 40-year-old British-Indian Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, the sole confirmed survivor was seated in seat 11A, near an emergency exit. “Thirty seconds after takeoff, there was a loud noise, and then the plane crashed,” Ramesh told Hindustan Times from his hospital bed at Ahmedabad’s Civil Hospital. “When I got up, there were bodies all around me. I was scared. I stood up and ran. There were pieces of the plane all around me.” Footage showed the bloodied but determined Ramesh limping toward an ambulance, a testament to his survival against all odds.

Ramesh, who lives in London and was visiting family in Ahmedabad, suffered impact injuries but was able to walk away from the wreckage. Tragically, his brother, Ajay Kumar Ramesh, 45, who was seated in a different row, remains missing. “We visited Diu. He was traveling with me, and I can’t find him anymore. Please help me find him,” a distraught Vishwash pleaded.

Hope for More Survivors

Ahmedabad Police Commissioner GS Malik initially reported no survivors but later confirmed Ramesh’s survival and suggested others might be alive. “One survivor has been found in the hospital and is under treatment. We cannot rule out more survivors,” Malik told ANI. Senior police officer Vidhi Chaudhary added that “a few more survivors could be in the hospital,” while Air India CEO Campbell Wilson stated that “injured passengers have been taken to the nearest hospital.” As of now, 41 injured individuals are receiving treatment, and the fate of 38 passengers remains unclear.

A Nation in Mourning, A World in Shock

The crash, which claimed the life of former Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani among others, has sent shockwaves globally. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the scenes “devastating,” while King Charles and Queen Camilla expressed being “desperately shocked.” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the tragedy as “heartbreaking beyond words.” The plane’s impact on the medical college dining area left half-finished plates of food amid the rubble, a haunting reminder of lives cut short.

Chaos and Heroism at the Crash Site
Videos showed a massive fireball and debris-strewn streets as rescuers worked tirelessly. “It is chaos. Ambulances are rushing to hospitals,” local journalist Sunil Vaidya told Al Jazeera. The crash site, cordoned off by authorities, remains a grim tableau of twisted metal and shattered lives. Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited the site and met with the injured, confirming Ramesh’s survival after speaking with him at the hospital. A thorough investigation, led by Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu, is underway to uncover the cause of the disaster.

Vishwash Kumar Ramesh likely survived the Air India Flight AI171 crash due to his seat, 11A, being near an emergency exit, allowing a quick escape.

This time, the reporter of a national television channel is seen standing in neck-deep water, attempting to assess the deteriorating road conditions near Laal Quila in Delhi amidst heavy downpours in the capital city.

To report the condition of the city after incessant rainfall led to waterlogged streets, the journalist stood in the dangerously flooded area when there were safer and not-so-flooded areas just on the side.

He makes a pithy comment about the water coming up to the neck and draws a parallel to the current political situation in the country saying it is reporters neck-deep in waters is symbolic of Delhi's Mughal history drowning.

Several people expressed that there was no need for the journalist to submerge himself in the floodwater while reporting about the condition of Delhi. 

They said, “he could have very easily stood on the side and pointed the camera towards the flooded underpass."" Some even called for awards for these Bravehearts, and cheekily suggested that they be honoured with the 'Baadhnath Goenka' award.

Meanwhile, the national capital continued to witness a flood-like situation on Friday in several low-lying areas even as the water level of the Yamuna River continue to decrease after breaching the danger mark.

MJO getting back to Phase 2 tomorrow. That's good news for South West Monsoon.
It was last in Phase2 and Phase3 from June 7th to June 14th. It coincided with Cyclone Biparjoy. Its north moving path was such that it helped in setting SWM over Kerala and Karnataka but did not help much with the rains.

Its expected to generate LPA in north bay of Bengal. That would reactivate the monsoon flow across western coastline and the tugging ghat section.

Its expected to exit Phase 4 by July 5th. 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 are very good. Phase 4 is supportive. So almost 12-13 active SWM days expected.

Hope Karavali and Malnad rains will peak during this time. Its been a dull monsoon so far for coast and the catchment areas.

The National Weather Service issued a life-threatening Flash Flood Emergency, with emergency crews conducting water rescues amidst difficult access conditions. The flooding has caused significant disruption, with vehicles being swept away and widespread flooding reported.  🚧

Last Occurrence in the Region:
The last similar severe flash flood event in the Fairmont area occurred in March 2025, when a storm caused extensive damage, including a roof being torn off a residential building. This indicates a recurring pattern of extreme weather events in the region within a short period.

But India seems determined to keep digging itself deeper. After being saved from disaster and total military defeat on May 10th thanks to Trump’s timely intervention, New Delhi is now turning on the very man who pulled them back from the edge.

The question is obvious: if you despised Trump so much, why did you beg for his help when your back was against the wall?

In a desperate attempt to appease the Sangh loyalists and right-wing cultists at home, India is about to wreck what little remains of its international credibility, by attacking Trump. Instead of damage control, they’re opting for self-inflicted shame. 

We know that another reckless misadventure is being planned by India against Pakistan. But this time, if Pakistan hits back hard and it will, Modi may discover that Trump is no longer interested in saving him a second time.

But India seems determined to keep digging itself deeper. After being saved from disaster and total military defeat on May 10th thanks to Trump’s timely intervention, New Delhi is now turning on the very man who pulled them back from the edge.

The question is obvious: if you despised Trump so much, why did you beg for his help when your back was against the wall?

In a desperate attempt to appease the Sangh loyalists and right-wing cultists at home, India is about to wreck what little remains of its international credibility, by attacking Trump. Instead of damage control, they’re opting for self-inflicted shame. 

We know that another reckless misadventure is being planned by India against Pakistan. But this time, if Pakistan hits back hard and it will, Modi may discover that Trump is no longer interested in saving him a second time.
